     * We do need a boolean array to mark the travel days, the reason is if it is not a travel day we don't need a ticket. However, if it is a travel day, we consider three scenarios (with three types of tickects):
     *
     * If a 1-day ticket on day i, dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + cost[0]
     * If a 7-day ticket ending on day i, dp[i] = min(dp[i - 7], dp[i - 6] ... dp[i - 1]) + cost[1]
     * If a 30-day ticket ending on day i, dp[i] = min(dp[i - 30], dp[i - 29] ... dp[i - 1]) + cost[2]
     *
     * But since the value of dp array is increasing, therefore:
     * For a 7-day ticket ending on day i, dp[i] = dp[i - 7] + cost[1]
     * For a 30-day ticket ending on day i, dp[i] = dp[i - 30] + cost[2]
